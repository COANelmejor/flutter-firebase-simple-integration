## Notes

### Add Windows Support

I got on a problem. When I tried to add support for Windows Desktop, I got an error becuase of the name of the folder.

The parent folder name was `flutter-firebase-simple-integration`. This name was created as a result of the github repo name.

To make it work, I had to rename the folder to `flutter_firebase_simple_integration`.
